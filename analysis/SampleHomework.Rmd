This is a sample of how I would like the homework to look when turned in.  _It will look a bit better imo, because you will knit to pdf rather than html as shown here._

# Homework 1 
# Your Name 
# Date

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
##### 
##### 
##### Project setup #####
##### 
##### 
##### 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
library(stargazer)
library(knitr)
##### 
##### 
```

## Problem 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this, note that `kable` makes REALLY nice tables with ZERO effort as seen in Table 1.  Don't just print output to consol, use kable!!  In my opinion, including code to create tables in-line is a detraction, this is simply to show you how easy it is to do it.  Code that is relevant to the problem should be included, code that is for display or as a summary, should be omitted in-line and it is up to you on if it should be included in an Appendix.

```{r Problem1a}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 1: Data summary #####
##### output using kable
##### 
##### 
kable(summary(cars), caption = "Table 1: Quick summary of car data.")
```

Likewise, `stargazer` simplifies making tables of linear model output.  See Table 2 below.  See how simple??  Note that you don't need to set the type AND it will look better when knit to pdf.
 
```{r Problem1b, results='asis'}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 1: Quick lm #####
##### output using Stargazer
##### 
##### 
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
stargazer(fit,header = F,type = "html", title="Table 2: Output of dist~speed for cars data linear model")
```

## Problem 2

You can also embed plots. As far as I can tell, unless you are using Bookdown (or perhaps knitting to pdf), referencing the figure with automatically numbered figures is not possible.  Perhaps someone in class knows differently??  

```{r Problem2a, fig.cap='Figure 1: A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
##### 
##### 
##### Problem 2: plot #####
##### making a pie chart
##### 
#####  
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```

# Appendix 1: R code

If you name the code chucks, it is easy to include code not really important to the main text but necessary as an Appendix.  As you will see below, this is why I was overly "commenty" in my code.  To do so, create a code chunk that starts like this:

```
{r Appendix, ref.label=c("setup","Problem1a","Problem1b","Problem2a"), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, include=T}
```

For instance:

```{r Appendix, ref.label=c("setup","Problem1a","Problem1b","Problem2a"), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, include=T}
  
```
