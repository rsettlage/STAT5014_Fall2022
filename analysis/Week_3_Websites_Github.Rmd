## Today's Agenda

- Review the concepts of Reproducible Research  
- Review Good Programming Practices  
- Go through Sample Homework 
- Review Git  
 
  
## Reproducible Research - Review

This IS (always) the scenario:  
You had worked 6 months to analyze a data set.  Someone else analyzes the data and comes to *different* conclusions.  How good are your notes???

Answer: **_Awesome, because you annotated your code with text to create a RR compendium_**

### Reproducible Research - Concepts
**_Basically just switching the role of code and comments in writing software_**

Guide to this topic here: 
<http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/>

In general, we should **weave** code and text into a complete reference of our work.  The document should:

- download or otherwise load/generate data
- reproduce steps to munge data
- recreate analysis steps
- create figures and tables
- explain any and all steps along the way
- end with conclusions drawn
- optionally add suggestions for future experiments

## Back to Reproducible Research Analysis

## Good Programming Practices

Most analysis will require some amount of programming (scripting).  As we program, we should strive to create readable and reusable code.  The art of creating good code is captured in the broad and opinionated topic of Good Programming Practices.  You will devolop your own style, but it would be good to start with some guidance from some experts.

## Good Programming Practices cont

Remember: ultimate goal is Reproducible Research.  
To enable this, we need well documented (annotated) _**readable**_ code.

1. variable/object names  
    + nouns describing what the object holds, e.g. originaData instead of d  
    + DO NOT use existing variables or functions, e.g. T<-1000
2. function formation  
    + function names should be verb associated with the function purpose  
    + comment both function purpose and required arguments    
    + arguments should have defaults (my personal preference)
    + my preference is to explicitly return a value  
3. commenting rules  
    + comment your code!!  'nough said?  
4. indent within logical blocks of code !!
    + indenting improves the readability of the code by orders of magnitude!  

## Version Control  

What is version control - a system for storing data and tracking changes.   

- Why should I use version control?

Thoughts or comments??

## Version Control and Git

Git is essentially a database of snapshots of the project directory tree.  You decide when and what to take snapshots of and if you using GitHub (or similar) when to push a copy to a remote repository.

The basic workflow is:  

1. git **pull**  
2. **do work**  
3. git **pull** to make sure you have latest files
4. git **add** *\<your changed file\>* tells git what change you care about  
5. git **commit** -m "some INFORMATIVE message about the changes"  
6. git **push** to the repository (local or remote)  
7. repeat  

When in doubt, try git **status** to get, well, the local repo status  


## Websites in (R)Markdown

Here, we will build a personal website using R/Rmarkdown.

Some packages:

+ blogdown  
+ distillr  
+ workflowr  
+ portfoliodown  
+ quarto  

## blogdown

https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/  

## workflowr  

https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/index.html

## portfoliodown

## distillr

https://rstudio.github.io/distill/  
https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html  

blog or website?

Basically the same with a blog building a set of post cards from a directory of blog posts.  

## Quarto

https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/  
https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/#deploying-the-site   

https://quarto.org/docs/websites/  
https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html  
   

## Step 1 - create repo with README and .nojekyll   

We are going to host our static site on GitHub, so start by making a new repo on GitHub.  We want this to be our personal website, so we need to name it special in order for GitHub to publish it correctly.

+ On Github, new repo and name it using your GitHub user name like so:  
YOUR_USERNAME.github.io

For me, that is `rsettlage.github.io`

+ Go ahead and add a README.md and add a link to the future website, for me, for instance:  
[rsettlage.github.io](https://rsettlage.github.io)

+ Also, we need to add a file called `.nojekyll` to the base of the repo so that GitHub doesn't re-render our website.  Go ahead and do that from the GitHub interface.  NOTE: yes, it starts with a "." dot.  

+ finally, add a `.gitignore` with the following lines:
```
/.quarto/
/_site/
```

## Step 2 - configure repo to publish 

Within the repo, you need to tell GitHub to publish the page.

+ Go to settings for the repo  
+ left hand side, choose `Pages`  
+ Source should be changed to "Deploy from a branch"  
+ then choose master and docs (may be main instead of master)  
+ note, we have set GitHub to publish from within the `docs` folder, so that is where our rendered html should land.

![Branch](./figure/Branch.png)

## Step 3  - clone repo to local computer  

In the terminal:  
```
git clone git@github.com:rsettlage/rsettlage.github.io.git
```

## Step 4 - choose a R package to do the dev in

I am going to use Quarto.  Two reasons:

1. I haven't used it before, so should be an interesting test  
2. It is supposedly language agnostic, ie, you can render in R or Python and others  
(3. unverified, but looks like you can embed dynamic widgets, so super cool...)

https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/  

Steps:
a. download and install  
b. choose Rstudio  
c. download the `hello.qmd`  
d. click render and enjoy success  

## Step 5 - start your Quarto website  

In the terminal:  

```
cd rsettlage.github.io
quarto create-project ./ --type website:blog
```

## Step 6 - Edit '_quarto.yml'

We need to at least tell Quarto we want the rendered site to go into the `docs` folder so that it is compatible with GitHub.  To do so, edit the `_quarto.yml` file.

Add the third line to the project section as below:  

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

Note, this is a `yml` file.  They are super readable and VERY picky.  The alignment of the options is critical and needs to be spaces, NOT tabs.  PITA, but, be happy it isn't json.

## Step 7 - Preview site  

This is a live preview and change, pretty awesome actually.

In terminal, type:  
```
quarto preview ./
```

Open up the `about.qmd` file, change something and save it.

## Step 8 - Render the site, then push to GitHub

```
quarto render ./
git add .
git commit -m "going live"
git push
```

Now go to your site (could take a min or two) as in the readme.

https://rsettlage.github.io  

There are a whole bunch of options for render/publishing, for now, I am listing them as super cool sounding but I don't yet have as experience, see the docs:
https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html  

## Next steps:

+ choose a theme  
+ add links to your stuff: LinkedIn, GitHub, GoogleScholar, ...  
+ choose a way to highlight your projects, looks like a "listing" is how they handle blogs  
+ add more pages
